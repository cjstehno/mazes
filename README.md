# Mazes for Programmers (Groovy port)

I am reading the book "[Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers)" by Jamis Buck, which has its example code 
written in Ruby. While Ruby is a great language, Groovy is my language of choice; so, as part of reading the book, I am loosely porting the code
from the book to Groovy.

Note: this is not intended to be an official port of the code from the book. I am making my own changes as I see fit. If you are reading the book and
want the Groovy version of the code, you can at least have this as a general reference.
